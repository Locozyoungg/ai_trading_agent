‚öôÔ∏è Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bybit-ai-trading-agent.git
cd bybit-ai-trading-agent


2. Install Python & Dependencies
Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed. If not, install it first.

Install required Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

üåç Environment Setup
1. Setup API Keys
Create a .env file to store your Bybit API keys and other configuration settings.
cp .env.example .env
nano .env

Inside the .env file, add your Bybit API key and secret:
BYBIT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BYBIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
ENABLE_PROFIT_TRACKER=True
ENABLE_STRATEGY_REPORT=True
ENABLE_MARKET_INSIGHTS=True

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your real Bybit API credentials.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
1. Start the AI Trading Agent
Run the agent in a screen session to ensure it runs continuously even when disconnected from the server.
screen -S trading_bot
python main.py

To detach from the screen session, press CTRL + A, then D. To reattach:
screen -r trading_bot

2. Monitor Strategy & Profit
Use the following scripts to monitor the agent's performance:

Profit Tracker: Tracks real-time P&L.
python tracking/profit_tracker.py

üöÄ Deployment
1. Set Up Server
For production, deploy the AI trading agent on a VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS, Linode).
Ensure that your server has Python 3 installed and the environment is set up.

2. Run with Cron Jobs
To continuously track profits and market insights, set up cron jobs to run the scripts automatically:
crontab -e

Add the following cron jobs to run every 5 minutes:
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/tracking/profit_tracker.py
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/tracking/strategy_report.py
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/analysis/market_insights.py

üîß Configuration
